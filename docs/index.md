# Ready to Start and Explore

## Highlights

Prebuilt libraries and required header files packaged with [Conan](https://conan.io/)

- For several target architectures build (cross-compiled) with one compiler (GCC-9):
  - x64
  - ARM-v7
  - ARM-v8
- Convenient with build configurations `Release` and `Debug`

## Requirements

One of the compilers:

- Conan application as C++ package-manager
- GCC compiler
- A target generator e.g. CMake
- Build essentials, make
